# Feedback

We both know that you are capable.  We also know that this output is not indicative of the effort you put in.  I assume you are used to hearing that.  I'm hoping that we can see progress on bringing these in line, over the next few weeks.  I think your best course of action was already identified, by you: "Start simple".  Once you have something working, I'd love to hear more about your investigations into devise.

What specifically would you like feedback on?
> How I can improve on the general concept of it... I'm redoing the actual app because the code itself is a jumbled up mess but I want the app to be as user friendly as possible

What would you do differently next time?
> Start simple

Amen.


## Project Workflow

**Meets expectations**

Good user stories.  Which ones did you complete during this week?  

Decent commit history, with meaningful messages (usually).  I recommend you work on smaller, more concrete, steps.  When your commit message says "added devise", yet most of the commit deals with posts, it indicates to me that you are rushing, taking big steps, or not focused. :(

I see that you did some work with rspec.  Good job.  However, not one spec is passing?  Were they at one point?  You added rspec at 1:40pm on Wed, removed it at 4:40pm, and the next commit contains a spec -- that night at 00:50.  You have a few spurious commits (reflecting the hour), before "first controller profile spec is working" at 4am (that's 15 hours after you first added rspec).  Only to commit "doesn't work" 3 hours later.  I see work on devise routes, links, welcome controller, seeding Users, and more.  When you finally get to "first controller profile spec is working", there are no code changes in that commit - just a spec.

"added first picture of dog" 9pm, Thursday night.


## Technical Requirements

**Meets Expectations**

Technically. :)

I only see a couple github issues from you.  In the future, please utilize us more.

## Creativity / Interface

**Does Not Meet expectations**

Puppies!  That was almost enough. :)

Nice, clean, responsive design (thanks, Bootstrap).  The links either do nothing or take me to pages with errors.  I also expect a more uniform image size.

## Code Quality

**Meets Expectations**

Like the interface, the app shows signs of thrashing and most things are "mostly" done.  I recommend you pick something small and get it all the way to done.  I only a made a few in-line comments.  I'm happy to pair.

## Deployment and Functionality

**Does not meet expectations**

You have a good baseline of an app to build on. It shouldn't take long to complete these features (for your profile page).
